# Local baking mode - creates ticket and openspec folders in current working directory
# When enabled, Bakery will create folders in the directory where the command is run
# instead of using the base_directory. This is useful for per-project ticket organization.
# Example: If you run `bakery -t 12345` in /projects/my-project/, folders will be created at:
#   /projects/my-project/Tickets/12345/   (for ticket data)
#   /projects/my-project/openspec/        (for OpenSpec plans)
# When disabled, folders are created in the configured base_directory:
#   {base_directory}/Tickets/12345/      (for ticket data)
#   {base_directory}/openspec/           (for OpenSpec plans)

# Use {prompt} as a placeholder for the generated prompt.

# Examples:
# Claude (recommended): ai_command_template = "claude -p \"{prompt}\""
# Your dev script: ai_command_template = "dev --platform anthropic --non-interactive \"{prompt}\""
# OpenAI CLI: ai_command_template = "openai api chat.complete --messages \"{prompt}\""
# Custom AI tool: ai_command_template = "your-ai-tool --prompt \"{prompt}\""
#
# The command will execute with {prompt} replaced by the generated OpenSpec prompt.
# Make sure your chosen AI CLI is accessible via system PATH or provide full paths.
# Note: Use "claude -p" for direct Claude CLI access, or "claude --non-interactive" for scripted use.
